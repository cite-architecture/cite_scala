# cite_scala has been superseded

The entire source tree from this repository (both test and main) has been incorporated into the `xcite` repository at [https://github.com/cite-architecture/xcite](https://github.com/cite-architecture/xcite). 

The `xcite` library is cross-compiled for both the JVM and for ScalaJS (both JVM and JS include compiles for Scala 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12).  If you just want binaries, `xcite` is available from jcenter.
